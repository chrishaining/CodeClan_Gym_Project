#My learning aims for the gym project#

*Get to grips with http protocols - restful*
*improve my understanding of Ruby data structures, so that I know: what type of data structure my methods are going to produce/have produced; how to return the information I want based on that data structure.*
*practise the planning techniques - UX and UML diagrams*
*keep on top of the PDA work*
*I want to make sure I am not spending too much time on CSS. It's not a big focus for this project and if I get carried away it could eat into the time I should be spending on other tasks.*
