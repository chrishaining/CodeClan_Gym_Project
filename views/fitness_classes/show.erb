<h2><%= @fitness_class.name %></h2>

<p>Class ID: <%= @fitness_class.id %></p>

<!-- my problem is that @fitness_class isn't being recognised in the way I hoped. It means that the methods .id, .name and .attendees don't work. I can access name and id using [''], but not attendees. See the experiment.rb for the original code. -->
